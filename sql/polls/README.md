# Polls App

A bare-bones Rails app that manages polls,
their questions and answers, and responses,
used to practice ActiveRecord associations and joins.

Relevant code includes:

- The migrations in `db/migrate`
- The models in `app/models`

*Note:* We specified the `primary_key`, `foreign_key`, and `class_name`
options for all associations for practice.
