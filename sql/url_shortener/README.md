# URL Shortener

A bare-bones Rails app that shortens URLs,
used to practice ActiveRecord migrations and associations.

Run command-line interface with: `rails runner bin/cli`

*Note:* We specified the `primary_key`, `foreign_key`, and `class_name`
options for all associations for practice.

Pair programming partner: Shah Rukh Paracha
