# Questions Database

This project provides a definition and object-oriented interface for a questions
database, storing users, questions, likes, following, and replies. It uses a
SQLite3 database and raw SQL within classes representing database tables.
It served as practice for writing SQL queries and a precursor to using 
ActiveRecord.
